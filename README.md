# spectralspiral

A p5.js sonic visualizer

## To run on your own
Download the files, and launch `spiral.html` in a web browser (developed in chrome). The p5 and p5.sound libraries are linked to over the internet, so you will need internet access for this to run properly. If you want offline access, download local copies of those js files and update the paths inside the `<script>` tags in the html file. The behavior and appearance of the spiral can be altered by changing some of the values of the constants that are set at the top of `sketch.js`.
